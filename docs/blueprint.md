## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) for a professional, modern, and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0), near-white, to ensure readability and a clean design.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), a muted analogous shade, to provide visual interest to actionable elements such as links and buttons.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, for a techy, modern look. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, readable style.
- Use simple, line-based icons for social media and project categories. The style should complement the modern typography.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout to present projects in an organized and visually appealing manner. Ensure the website is responsive and looks good on all devices.
- Use subtle animations, such as fade-in effects, on scroll or when hovering over project items, to add a touch of interactivity and sophistication.
